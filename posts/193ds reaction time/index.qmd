This statistical analysis was assigned in my ENVS 193DS: Statistics for Environmental Science class.

The question being analyzed was: Does the amount of sleep I get affect my reaction speed when I wake up?

The data was collected by myself and stored in an Excel sheet for later analysis in R Studio. Every morning, the first thing I would do is take a reaction speed test on my mobile device. These reaction speed scores were saved and recorded, then compared to the amount of sleep I had goten that night to see if a relationship existed. Sleep times were binned into three bins: short (\<7 h), moderate (7–8 h), and long (\>8 h), and then mean sleep time was compared across bins.

## What is that mutate(marker)?

This function was used to create a hovering tooltip for the interactive figure. The marker function uses the defined titles associated with specific sections of the table's data to create a useful menu.

This function will be used again in the [Data Visualization] code block.

## Table Column Definitions

SleepBin: using sleep Duration column, all data points are binned into three bins: short (\<7 h), moderate (7–8 h), and long (\>8 h) sleep times

Date: year, month, and day that the data was recorded. Each point was recorded immediately after waking up that morning

sleep_duration_hh_ss: hours and minutes that I slept on that day

reaction_speed_ms: reaction speed score in milliseconds as tested by <https://humanbenchmark.com/tests/reactiontime>

x5_test_avg_ms: average reaction test score after five attempts of the test

sleep_location: where in my house I had slept that night, either my bed or on my couch.

stress_level: self described stress level for the coming day, including classes, homework, social events, work, etc, recorded using this general metric

1: low stress day

2: moderate stress day

3: high stress day

### Affective visualization

With this piece, I am attempting to showcase the takeaway of my experiment, which is that the amount of sleep has an effect on the reaction speed score on an online speed test immediately after waking up. The data was collected over two months and sorted into three bins: short (\<7 h), moderate (7–8 h), and long (\>8 h), and then mean sleep time was compared across bins.

When creating this piece, I wanted to incorporate several relevant themes into the visualization of this data, including concepts of tiredness, energy, and alertness. Although it might not look explicitly similar, I took a lot of inspiration from Jill Pelto's paintings, specifically their ingraining of the geometry of the line in the art.

The form of my work is a drawn picture on paper using a combination of colored pencils, markers, lead pencils, and more. Conceptually, each bin is represented by a neuron with each data point being represented by a dendrite upon the axon, which is itself a representation of the error bars. The hope is to show that more sleep creates more complex neural connections with shorter pathways.

Before it took this form, my first sketch had more of a night and day gradient motif using an eye to stage the data, but I didn't like it very much and scrapped it. This version was sketched in MS Paint before being put to paper and drawn with strong lines and colors. I recieved feedback that the message of the data isn't immediately apparent, so I could improve that if I redid this visualization.
