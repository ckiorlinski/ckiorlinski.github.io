**Welcome!**

I am a highly passionate and detail-driven Environmental Scientist with a solid foundation in data analysis, technical writing, field work, public outreach, and more. Having recently graduated from University of California, Santa Barbara with a Bachelors of Science in Environmental Studies, I am excited to begin advancing environmental sustainability through innovative solutions.

I am currently seeking new employment after graduation, so please reach out if you have any opportunities!
