    "text": "Hello!\nI was born in Oxnard, California to two Bulgarian immigrant parents who worked their butts off to provide for my brother and I. Education was the biggest priority in our house, and that mindset of diligence and resilience eventually led to me studying environmental science at my dream school, the University of California Santa Barbara. As a recent graduate, I am very excited to enter the world of professional environmentalism and hopefully make some dents in what I consider the worldâ€™s most pressing issues!\n\n\nConservation and Restoration Work\nAlthough I always saw myself as more of a lab scientist, attending UCSB and working as a Conservation and Restoration Intern at Coal Oil Point Reserve introduced me to the wonderful world of field work! From local spots like Sands Beach in Isla Vista to more intense locations like the Mojave Desert, I have had the pleasure of working side by side with environmental experts and fellow students in a multitude of conditions.\n\n\n\nMojave Research Team ENVS 114B\n\n\n\n\n\nRestoration at Elwood Marine Terrace with COPR\n\n\n\n\nCulinary Arts\nOne of my favorite hobbies as long as I can remember has been cooking and expressing myself through food. Beyond the end product that hopefully tastes good, cooking functions as a social activity that allows me to spend time and learn from my parents or peers. I also find it very gratifying creating something delicious for the people who I care about. It helps being the child of immigrants, as I have access to the entire world of Bulgarian cooking at my fingertips, alongside the hundreds of cultural recipes that litter the internet. Some of my favorite cultures to pull recipes from include Indian, Thai, Bulgarian, Chinese, and Mexican.\n\n\n\nBaklava\n\n\n\n\n\nRasam and Aloo Fry with Jasmine Rice\n\n\n\n\nMy Dog\nWe saved our dog, Jesso, from a kill shelter after a family friend could no longer take care of them. He is a Cairn Terrer and is almost 10 years old now. We welcomed him into our family at the end of 2016. He is very cute and we love him very much.\n\n\n\ndog"

    "text": "What Drives Me\nIn my opinion, it is the passion of the environmentalist that is their greatest weapon. It is what keeps us vitalized and ready to tackle problems at an immense scale despite the overwhelming amount of depressing and upsetting information that we are privy to. In the face of this dread, environmentalists such as myself only have our passion and hope for the future to hold on to and give comfort. In a field as volatile and immediately relevant as our global environmental systems, whether it be climate, ecology, or energy, there is thankfully a lot to be passionate about. Here are some of the topics that drive me in this field.\n\n\nEnvironmental Microbiology\nEnvironmental microbiology investigates how the interactions of microorganisms with each other and their environment shape microbial communities and their roles in ecosystems. This field investigate these microorganisms as both agents of environmental degradation and potential solutions through bioremediation, although I am primarily interested in the bioremediation aspect. Through cultivation of specific environments or genetic editing, microorganisms can achieve amazing feats, such as pollutant removal or energy production.\nThe primary application of this that I am interested in is anaerobic digestion as a method of dually producing energy and reducing landfill waste. This natural process consists of a series of biochemical reactions where bacteria break down organic matter of any substrate into a gaseous mixture (CH4, CO2, H2, H2S, etc.) in the absence of free oxygen. The main byproduct of this process is biogas, a mix of methane and carbon dioxide, which can be used for power or heat generation. The digested solid waste, called digestate, can be separated into liquid and solid streams, both of which contain valuable plant nutrients that can be used as fertilizer in agricultural applications.\n\n\n\nExample Diagram of Digestor\n\n\n\n\nAdvanced Plastic Recycling via Pyrolysis\nPyrolysis is a thermochemical recycling method that decomposes plastic waste at extreme temperatures in an anaerobic setting to break down polymers into useful compounds, such as pyrolysis oil, fuel gas, and carbon char. Although this process is still new and facing backlash for several downsides, including emissions, scalability, and economic viability, I believe that this technology is an important piece of the circular economy needed to maintain human life on this planet.\n\n\n\nPyrolysis Diagram"
