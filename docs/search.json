It is what keeps us vitalized and ready to tackle problems at an immense scale despite the overwhelming amount of depressing and upsetting information that we are privy to. In the face of this dread, environmentalists such as myself only have our passion and hope for the future to hold on to and give comfort. In a field as volatile and immediately relevant as our global environmental systems, whether it be climate, ecology, or energy, there is thankfully a lot to be passionate about. Here are some of the topics that drive me in this field."

This field investigate these microorganisms as both agents of environmental degradation and potential solutions through bioremediation, although I am primarily interested in the bioremediation aspect. Through cultivation of specific environments or genetic editing, microorganisms can achieve amazing feats, such as pollutant removal or energy production.\nThe primary application of this that I am interested in is anaerobic digestion as a method of dually producing energy and reducing landfill waste. This natural process consists of a series of biochemical reactions where bacteria break down organic matter of any substrate into a gaseous mixture (CH4, CO2, H2, H2S, etc.) in the absence of free oxygen. The main byproduct of this process is biogas, a mix of methane and carbon dioxide, which can be used for power or heat generation. The digested solid waste, called digestate, can be separated into liquid and solid streams, both of which contain valuable plant nutrients that can be used as fertilizer in agricultural applications.\n\n\n\nExample Diagram of Digestor"

Blue Whales, along with other large mammals, face escalating threats due to human impact such as overfishing, underwater noise pollution, and ship strikes due to maritime activity (McKenna, 2011).\nThis project investigates areas of Blue Whale migration in the marine corridor between the Port of Hueneme and Santa Cruz Island– a marine area known for high vessel activity. By analyzing these two variables, our group aims to create visualizations that may aid in identifying high risk areas for blue whales and shipping vessels."

The data was collected over two months and sorted into three bins: short (&lt;7 h), moderate (7–8 h), and long (&gt;8 h), and then mean sleep time was compared across bins.\nWhen creating this piece, I wanted to incorporate several relevant themes into the visualization of this data, including concepts of tiredness, energy, and alertness. Although it might not look explicitly similar, I took a lot of inspiration from Jill Pelto’s paintings, specifically their ingraining of the geometry of the line in the art.\nThe form of my work is a drawn picture on paper using a combination of colored pencils, markers, lead pencils, and more. Conceptually, each bin is represented by a neuron with each data point being represented by a dendrite upon the axon, which is itself a representation of the error bars. The hope is to show that more sleep creates more complex neural connections with shorter pathways.\nBefore it took this form, my first sketch had more of a night and day gradient motif using an eye to stage the data, but I didn’t like it very much and scrapped it. This version was sketched in MS Paint before being put to paper and drawn with strong lines and colors. I recieved feedback that the message of the data isn’t immediately apparent, so I could improve that if I redid this visualization."
